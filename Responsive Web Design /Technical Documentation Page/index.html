                C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus" and sometimes abbreviated as CPP) is a high-level,
                general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup.
                First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997,
                C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation for systems
                like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows. It is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many
                vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.

                C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance,
                efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[15] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key
                strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[15] including desktop applications, video games,
                servers (e.g., e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g., telephone switches or space probes).

                In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.
                The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis.
                Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was
                too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development.
                When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing.
                Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was
                general-purpose, fast, portable, and widely used. In addition to C and Simula's influences, other languages influenced this new language,
                including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU, and ML.

                In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991.
                New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions,
                and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard.
                Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type.

                The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset,
                and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming
                language [designed] for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions"; and "offering both hardware access and
                abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages."

                C++ inherits most of C's syntax. A hello world program that conforms to the C standard is also a valid C++ hello word program.
                The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility
                to write a message to standard output:

            <p>
                The C++ standard consists of two parts: the core language and the standard library.
                C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes
                aggregate types (vectors, lists, maps, sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples), algorithms
                (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), input/output facilities (iostream, for reading from and writing to the console and files),
                filesystem library, localisation support, smart pointers for automatic memory management, regular expression support, multi-threading library,
                atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation),
                time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that does not use C++ exceptions
                into C++ exceptions, a random number generator, and a slightly modified version of the C standard library (to make it comply with the C++ type system).
            </p>

            <p>
                A large part of the C++ library is based on the Standard Template Library (STL).
                Useful tools provided by the STL include containers as the collections of objects
                (such as vectors and lists), iterators that provide array-like access to containers
                and algorithms that perform operations such as searching and sorting.

            <p>
                To give compiler vendors greater freedom, the <code>C++</code> standards committee decided not to dictate the implementation of name mangling,
                exception handling, and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by
                different compilers is expected to be incompatible. There are, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines
                or operating systems. For example, the Itanium <code>C++</code> ABI is processor-independent (despite its name) and is implemented by GCC and Clang.
            </p>

            <p>
                C++ is often considered to be a superset of C but this is not strictly true. Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly
                in C++ but there are a few differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example,
                C allows implicit conversion from <code>void*</code> to other pointer types but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines
                many new keywords, such as <code>new</code> and <code>class</code>, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.
